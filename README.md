# [Lemon Aide](https://blooming-inlet-69061.herokuapp.com/)

[Lemon Aide](https://blooming-inlet-69061.herokuapp.com/) is an application that allows users to view Lululemon products, save products to a list of favorites, and create outfits. The goal of this project was to teach ourselves Postgres, Knex, and Express to build our own API for our React app to connect to.

## Abstract
  ![Screen Shot 2022-01-12 at 5 37 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60856601/149245083-87c2126b-65a7-4494-998e-0aa566575f1a.png)


  This application's design was inspired by the need to aid Lulu fanatics with trying to figure out what Lululemon items coordinate well in an outfit. Lemon Aide allows a user to see all of their pieces of clothing, plan outfits, and favorite items. The inventory is loaded from a server and changes made on the front end are mirrored on the back end.

  Users can select a top, a bottom, and an accessory to build an outfit. They can also add products to their favorites. A user can click on the hamburger to show the navigation options which include the home, favorites, and outfits pages.

## Wins
  - Successfully being able to divide and conquer tasks and complete them in a timely manner.
  - Having at least two people pair and walk through a PR, request changes, and gracefully making those changes before the branch was merged to main.
  - Learning CSS tricks, useState, and different ways of doing things from each other’s work.
  - Our “your win is my win” attitude really guided us through many hiccups and disagreements.

## Challenges
  - Accidentally committing node modules and branching off of that branch caused them to persist until we created a git ignore file and removed them from every branch that was being merged. Unfortunately this skewed our contributions for lines of code that were written and deleted but the number of commits accurately depict that metric.
  - Eight day time-frame to learn about and implement a backend server, database, and frontend application with two features (favoriting and creating outfits).
  - Having so many modes of communication made it difficult for some of our team members to understand and remember what they were supposed to be working on. Luckily GH issues became a much better place to draw out, reference, and delegate tasks.
